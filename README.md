# UROS-Kernel
The Operating System that I am developing.

This code is not organised yet. It needs a lot of changes, and not rely especially on headers.

So, the drill: To execute this, you might just use the Makefile run argument.
If for some reason doesn't work, proceed to run the following command
`qemu-system-i386.exe -accel whpx -d int -no-shutdown -no-reboot UROS-Image.bin`
